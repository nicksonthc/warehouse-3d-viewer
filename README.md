## Philosophy

This project embodies the intersection of technical excellence and human reflection. While we build systems that may outlast us, we're reminded to:

- Cherish every moment of our finite time
- Use automation to free up space for meaningful work
- Create efficient systems that serve human flourishing
- Remember that technology should enhance, not replace, our humanity

*"Your warehouse system might last longer than your life. Cherish every moment. Use automation."*
